Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Observations:=
    Dataset Structure:
        The Iris dataset has 150 rows and 5 columns.
        It contains 4 columns with numerical data (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one categorical column (species).
    Missing Values:
        There are no missing values in the dataset, so no cleaning was needed.
    Data Types:
        The numerical columns are floats (e.g., sepal length), and the species column is a string (e.g., "setosa").

    Basic Statistics:
        Sepal length is around 5.8 cm on average, while petal length has more variation (larger standard deviation), indicating it might be a better way to tell species apart.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Observations:
    Basic Statistics:
        The average sepal length is around 5.8 cm, and petal length is 3.7 cm.
        Petal length has more variation compared to other measurements.
    Grouping by Species:
        The setosa species has smaller values for all measurements, especially petal length.
        The virginica species has larger petal lengths compared to the others
    Interesting Findings
        Petal length is a key feature that helps distinguish between species.

Task 3: Data Visualization
Observations:
    Line Chart (Petal Length by Species):
        The line chart shows that setosa has the smallest petal length, and virginica has the largest.
    Bar Chart (Average Petal Length by Species):
        The bar chart confirms that setosa has the smallest average petal length, and virginica has the largest.
    Histogram (Petal Length Distribution):
        The histogram shows that setosa has a narrow petal length range, while versicolor and virginica have wider distributions.
    Scatter Plot (Sepal Length vs Petal Length):
        The scatter plot reveals that the species are separated by petal and sepal lengths, with setosa clearly distinct from the others.
